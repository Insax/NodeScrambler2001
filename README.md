## OwO wats dis

This is a useless NodeJS Clone of [Syrapt0r](https://github.com/Syrapt0r)'s [WordScrambler2001](https://github.com/Syrapt0r/WordScrambler2001).

No, seriously. <br>
It's a completely unnecessary repository which makes me question my existence and everything I believed in. 

<hr>

**Why?** 

- Yes

<hr>

If you search for a strong and fast encrypter written in NodeJS, <br>
then keep on searching. You won't find it here.

## How 2 instol

**Wait wait wait wait...**

You are completely sure you want to do this? Like... A 100% positive?

0. Open up your favourite terminal (and navigate somewhere you want to download the repository to) <br><br>
1. Make sure you have nodejs installed. Test by  entering <br>
$ `node -v` <br>
If this returns a version number, NodeJS is installed. **If not**, get NodeJS <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/">here</a>. <br><br>
2. Clone the repository and navigate to it. If you have Git installed, type <br>
$ `git clone https://github.com/NLDev/NodeScrambler2001.git && cd NodeScrambler2001` <br>
If not, download it <a href="https://github.com/NLDev/NodeScrambler2001/archive/master.zip">here</a> and extract the ZIP file.<br>
Then navigate to the folder.<br><br>
3. Install all dependencies by typing <br>
$ `npm install`<br><br>
4. Finally: Start the thingy by typing <br>
$ `npm start`

**Alternative to `npm start`:**

We actually have sum pretty neat command line args ;3 <br>
Yah I was surprised too...
